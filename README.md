cd js-class-demos
```

## How to Use

To explore the demos:

1. Open the specific folder for the topic you're interested in.
2. Read the comments in the code to understand what's happening.
3. Run the code:
   - For JavaScript files that interact with the DOM, open the corresponding HTML file in your browser. OR Run the html file associated with the JS script in live server.
   - For standalone JavaScript files, you can run them directly in Node.js using the command:
     ```bash
     node filename.js
     ```
4. Modify the code and experiment with your own changes to reinforce your learning.
